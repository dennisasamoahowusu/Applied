Write a simple program that takes a filename as parameter and
prints out all the tokens in the file.

The program should run from command line.
e.g.
>python myprogram.py sampleprogram1.txt
e.g.
>java -jar myprogram.jar sampleprogram1.txt
e.g.
>myprogram.exe sampleprogram.txt

The tokens that are currently accepted are
	VAR - a single letter (e.g. B D E z a f) //we are not doing variables with more than one character

	NUM - a number (.e.g 123 43  543 ) //we are not doing decimal numbers yet
	OP_EQUAL - the "=" character
	OP_PLUS - the "+" character
	OP_MINUS - the "-" character
	OP_MULTIPLY - the "*" character
	OP_DIVIDE - the "/" character
	OP_SUBTRACT - the "-" character
	COMMENT - the "#" character
	END - Symbolizes end of the line (empty string)

For example, if sample.txt contains
A=B+10
*/#$()AD123c

then it should output as follows
A=B+10

        Token(VAR:A)
        Token(OP_EQUAL:=)
        Token(VAR:B)
        Token(OP_PLUS:+)
        Token(NUM:10)
        Token(END:)

*/#$()AD123c

        Token(OP_MULTIPLY:*)
        Token(OP_DIVIDE:/)
        Token(COMMENT:#)
        Token(UNKNOWN:$)
        Token(UNKNOWN:()
        Token(UNKNOWN:))
        Token(VAR:A)
        Token(VAR:D)
        Token(NUM:123)
        Token(VAR:c)
        Token(END:)

Please note the way the lines are being processed.
After a line is read, it is printed.
One empty line, then all the tokens are printed from the line.
